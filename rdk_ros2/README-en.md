# Node-RED ROS 2 Plugin

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ramp-eu/TTE.project1.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project is part of [DIH^2](http://www.dih-squared.eu/). The main goal is provide [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/) interoperability with
[ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/) and [FIWARE](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/). The plugin introduces in the
Node-RED palette new nodes dealing with:

### Type definition

In order to transmit information it is necessary to precisely define the composition of the data delivered.

Node-RED approach is based on [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) which is versatile and user friendly
but cannot be used to interoperate with industrial protocols that require language-independent type Description.

In order to provide this interoperability ROS2 introduced [IDL](https://www.omg.org/spec/IDL/4.2/About-IDL). Which is
a data type and interfaces descriptive language customary in industrial applications.

The new nodes make both: IDL type descriptions and well known ROS2 types available.

### ROS2 Publisher-Subscriber interface

Publisher and Subscriber nodes are provided to directly access its ROS2
counterparts.

Different topics and QoS can be selected. Also a global configuration node allows to select the ROS domain to enforce.

### FIWARE Context Broker Publisher-Subscriber interface

The Context Broker doesn't provide a Publisher-Subscriber
interface (works more like a database) but a translation can be easily performed if:

- Entities are understood as topics.
- Creating or setting an entry is understood as publishing.
- Notification callbacks on an entity are understood as subscribtion callbacks.

    + [FIWARE Examples](#fiware-examples)

## Background

The interoperability between the plugin and the ROS2 and FIWARE Broker environments is achieved using [WebSocket](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org//)
bridges to them. This was the natural choice given that Node-RED relies on WebSocket for front-end/back-end
communication.

These bridges are generated using [Integration-Service](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) an
[eProsima](https://www.eprosima.com/) open-source tool.

Using Integration-Service directly from the plugin was possible, but it was considered a better choice to create another
Node.js library ([is-web-api](https://github.com/eProsima/is-web-api), to abstract the bridge operation. This way:
 + The plugin can rely on any other bridge technology.
 + Development is simplified by enforcing separation of concerns.
 + Any other Node.js project (besides the plugin) can profit from the bridge library.

## Install

A [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) is provided to exemplify the set up on an argument provided ROS2 distro.

### Dependencies

Some of the following installation steps can be skipped if the target system already fulfils some of the requirements:

1. ROS2 installation. Follow the [official ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
   for the distro of choice. The Dockerfile is based on a ROS2 image, so this is not exemplified.

1. Install Node.js. The usual OS package managers (like `apt` on Ubuntu or `winget/chocolatey` on windows) provide it.
   An exhaustive list is available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
   Some package managers constrain the user to a specific version of Node.js. The Node.js [site](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   hints on how to install specific versions.

   For example, in `apt` is possible to add via location configuration file a new remote repository where all Node.js
   versions are available. This is the strategy that the Dockerfile uses:

   ```bash
   $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   $ chmod +x nodesource_setup.sh && sudo sh -c ./nodesource_setup.sh
   $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```
1. Install Node-RED. Follow the [official Node-RED installation guide](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local).
   The Dockerfile favors the easiest procedure which relies on `npm` (default Node.js package manager) which is
   available after Node.js installation step:

   ```bash
   $ npm install -g node-red
   ```

1. Install Integration-Service. Follow the [Integration-Service installation manual](https://integration-service.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/installation_manual/installation_manual.html#installation-manual).
   This is exemplified in the Dockerfile, basically it is build from sources downloaded from github. Dependencies
   associated with the build and bridge environments are required:

   ```bash
   $ apt-get update
   $ apt-get install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-program-options-dev libwebsocketpp-dev \
                      libboost-system-dev libboost-dev libssl-dev libcurlpp-dev \
                      libasio-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev git
   $ mkdir -p /is_ws/src && cd "$_"
   $ git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Integration-Service.git is
   $ git clone https://github.com/eProsima/WebSocket-SH.git
   $ git clone https://github.com/eProsima/ROS2-SH.git
   $ git clone https://github.com/eProsima/FIWARE-SH.git

   $ . /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh # customize the ROS2 distro: foxy, galactic, humble ...
   $ colcon build --cmake-args -DIS_ROS2_SH_MODE=DYNAMIC --install-base /opt/is
   ```

   Note that it uses the ROS2 build tool: [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io)
   As ROS2 it is necessary to source and
   [overlay](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/developer/environment.html).
   In order to simplify sourcing `/opt/is` was chosen as deployment dir. The overlay can be then sourced as:

   ```bash
   $ . /opt/is/setup.bash
   ```
   It will automatically load the ROS2 overlay too. After the overlay is sourced it must be possible to access the
   integration-service help as:

   ```bash
   $ integration-service --help
   ```

### Plugin installation

Once all the dependencies are available we can deploy the plugin via npm:
+ From npm repo:

   ```bash
   $ npm install -g node-red-ros2-plugin
   ```
+ From sources. `npm` allows direct deployment from github repo:

   ```bash
   $ npm install -g https://github.com/eProsima/node-red-ros2-plugin
   ```

   Or, as in the Dockerfile, from a local sources directory. The docker favors this approach to allow tampering with the
   sources.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/eProsima/node-red-ros2-plugin.git plugin_sources
   $ npm install -g  ./plugin_sources

   ```

## Usage

In order to test the plugin there are two options: follow the installation steps [above](#install) or run the
test container provided [here](./docker/README.md).

### Node-RED palette

The main concepts associated with Node-RED operation are explained [here](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/concepts).
The plugin nodes are displayed on the Node-RED palette as shown in the image. From there, they can be dragged into the
workspace.

![Palette layout](./docs/palette.jpg)

The palette is the pane on the left where all available nodes are classified by sections. Plugin ones appear under `ROS2`
and `FIWARE` (figure's red frame). The worksplace is the central pane where different flows are associated to the upper tabs.

> **_Note:_** the text that labels the node, changes from palette to workspace, and may change depending on the node
configuration.

### Definining a type

In order the publish or subscribe data we need first to specify the associated type. The plugin provides two options:

#### Choosing a predefined ROS2 type

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="250"><img name="ROS2 Type" src="./docs/ROS2Type.png" height="auto"></td>
        <td> This node represents a specific ROS2 Builtin Type. Once in the workspace, its set up dialog can be opened by
             doble clicking over it.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img name="ROS2 packages" src="./docs/packages.jpg" height="auto"/></td>
        <td> The dialog provides a Package drop-down control where all ROS2 msg packages are listed. </br>
             Once a package is selected the Message drop-down control allows selection of a package specific message.
             In this example the package selected is <tt>geometry_msgs</tt>.
             From this package the <tt>Point</tt> message is selected.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <td><img name="ROS2 Type label" src="./docs/ros2-type-name.png" height="auto"></td>
    <td> Once the dialog set up is saved, the node label changes to highligh the selected type in a <tt>package/message</tt> pattern.
    </td>
</table>

#### Defining a new type via IDL

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="250"><img name="IDL Type" src="./docs/IDLType.png" height="auto"></td>
        <td> This node represents a type defined by means of an IDL.
             IDL is a language that allows unambiguous specification of the interfaces that may be used to define the
             data types.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img name="IDL definition" src="./docs/idl-definition.jpg" height="auto"/></td>
        <td> The dialog provides an edit box where the desired IDL can be introduced</br>
             Note that in order to use the type in ROS2 it must follow several conventions:
                <ul>
                    <li>There must be an outer module which should match the message package name.</li>
                    <li>There must be an inner module called <tt>msg</tt>.</li>
                    <li>The type name must follow PascalCase convention.</li>
                </ul>
             By default a dummy message that follows the above guidelines is provided.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <td><img name="IDL Type label" src="./docs/idl-type-name.jpg" height="auto"></td>
    <td> Once the dialog set up is saved, the node label changes to highligh the selected type in a <tt>package/message</tt> pattern.
    </td>
</table>

#### Injecting a type instance into the pipeline

Node-RED pipelines start in *source nodes*. The most popular one is the [inject
node](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/nodes#inject) which requires the user to manually defined each field
associated to the type. In order to simplify this a specific node is introduced:

<img name="ROS2 Inject node" src="./docs/ROS2Inject.png" width="250" height="auto">

This node mimics the inject node behaviour but automatically populates the input dialog with the fields associated with
any *type node* linked to it. For example, if we wire together a `ROS Inject` and a `ROS Type` or `IDL Type` nodes as
shown in the figure:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="500"><img name="ROS Type inject flow" src="./docs/ROS2InjectPackage.jpg" height="auto"></td>
        <td width="500"><img name="IDL Type inject flow" src="./docs/ROS2InjectIDL.jpg" height="auto"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="500"><img name="ROS Type inject dialog" src="./docs/ROS2InjectPackageDialog.jpg" height="auto"></td>
        <td width="500"><img name="IDL Type inject dialog" src="./docs/ROS2InjectIDLDialog.jpg" height="auto"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The associated dialogs are populated with the linked type fields and types.

### ROS2 nodes usage

In order to interact with a ROS2 environment we must specify the same [domain id](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Domain-ID.html)
in use for that environment.

The *domain id* is a number in the range `[0, 166]` that provides isolation for ROS2 nodes.
It defaults to 0 and its main advantage is reduce the incomming traffic for each ROS2 node, discharging them and
speeding things up.

Another key concepts in the ROS2 environment are:

- [topic](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html)
one. A *topic* is a text string ROS2 nodes use to notify all other nodes in which data they are interested.
When a ROS2 node wants to send or receive data it must specify:
 + Which type is the data they want receive. For example the `geometry_msgs/Pose` we introduced [above](#choosing-a-predefined-ros2-type).
 + Topic associated with the data. For example `/marker_pose`, but in ROS2 topics are often *decorated* using
namespaces to simplify identification, as in `/eProsima/buildings/E3g1/room/F2h3/marker/4Rg1/pose`.

- [Quality of Service (QoS)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html). Those are
  policies that allow fine tunning of the communication between nodes. For example:
  + *History QoS* allows to discard messages if only the most recent one is meaningful for our purposes.
  + *Reliable QoS* enforces message reception by resending it until the receiver acknowledges it.
  + *Durability QoS* assures messages published before the receiver node creation would be delivered.

> **_Note:_** ROS2 nodes can only communicate if their respective QoS are compatible. Information on QoS compatibility
  is available [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings.html#qos-compatibilities).

#### ROS2 configuration node

A [Node-RED config node](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/concepts#config-node) is provided to set up the domain ID,
which is a global selection:

![ROS Config Node](./docs/ROS2ConfigNode.jpg)

> **_Note:_** The ROS2 default domain value is 0

#### ROS2 Publisher

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="250"><img name="ROS2 Publisher" src="./docs/ROS2Publisher.jpg" height="auto"></td>
        <td>This node represents a ROS2 publisher. It is able to publish messages on a specific topic with specific QoS</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img name="ROS2 Publisher Dialog" src="./docs/ROS2PublisherDialog.jpg" height="auto"/></td>
        <td>The dialog provides controls to configure:
            <dl>
                <dt>Topic</dt><dd>Note that the backslash <tt>/</tt> typical of ROS2 topics is not necessary</dd>
                <dt>Domain ID</dt><dd>Selected globally via the configuration node explained
                <a href="#ros2-configuration-node">above</a></dd>
                <dt>QoS</dt><dd>The <tt>+add</tt> button at the bottom adds new combo-boxes to the control where the
                available options for each policy can be selected</dd>
            </dl>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### ROS2 Subscriber

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="250"><img name="ROS2 Subscriber" src="./docs/ROS2Subscriber.jpg" height="auto"></td>
        <td>This node represents a ROS2 subscriber. It is able to subscribe on a specific topic and receive all messages
        published for it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img name="ROS2 Subscriber Dialog" src="./docs/ROS2PublisherDialog.jpg" height="auto"/></td>
        <td>The dialog provides controls to configure:
            <dl>

                <dt>Domain ID</dt><dd>Selected globally via the configuration node explained
                <a href="#ros2-configuration-node">above</a></dd>
                <dt>QoS</dt><dd>The <tt>+add</tt> button at the bottom adds new combo-boxes to the control where the
                available options for each policy can be selected</dd>
            </dl>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### ROS2 Examples

#### ROS2 Basic Publication Example

Let's show how to use a custom type.

1. Launch docker compose as explained [here](./docker/README.md).
1. Create and wire the following nodes:
    + An `IDL Type` node. Open the associated dialog and introduce the following idl:

    ```c
    module custom_msgs {
        module msg {
            struct Message {
                string text;
                uint64 value;
            };
        };
    };
    ```
    + A `ROS Publisher` node. Open the associated dialog and set up the publisher:

        `Topic`
        : hope

        `Domain`
        : 42

    + A `ROS Inject` node. Open the associated dialog and fill in the fields:

        `text`
        : Hello World!

        `value`
        : 42

1. Deploy the flow pressing the corresponding button. Once deployed, the custom type has been registered in the ROS2 distro.

1. Let's launch a subscriber from the
[ROS2 cli](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Understanding-ROS2-Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html#id7).

```bash
$ docker exec -ti --env ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 docker-visual-ros-1 /ros_entrypoint.sh ros2 topic echo /hope custom_msgs/msg/Message
```
1. Now click on the inject node button within the editor and see how the terminal receives the data.

> **_Note:_** In the example the ROS2 domain value selected is 42, different from the default value of 0.

![ROS2 Publisher](./docs/ROS2Publisher.gif)

#### ROS2 Basic Subscription Example

In this case, a builtin ROS2 type (`geometry_msgs/Point`) will be used.

1. Launch docker compose as explained [here](./docker/README.md).
1. Create and wire the following nodes:
    + A `ROS2 Type` node. Open the associated dialog and select:

        `Package`
        : geometry_msgs

        `Message`
        : Point

    + A `ROS2 Subscriber` node. Open the associated dialog and set up the subscriber:

        `Topic`
        : hope

        `Domain`
        : 17

    + A `debug` node from the `common` palette section. Open the associated dialog and set it up to show the x
    coordinate of the point:

        `Output`
        : `msg.x`

1. Deploy the flow pressing the corresponding button.
1. Publish a message on that topic from the ROS2 cli. In this example we launch a new container connected to the same
network using the standard `ros:humble` image.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -ti --env ROS_DOMAIN_ID=17 --network docker_visualros ros:humble \
         ros2 topic pub /hope geometry_msgs/msg/Point "{ x: 42, y: 0, z: 0 }"
```

![turtlesim](./docs/ROS2Subscriber.gif)

#### ROS2 Mandatory Turtlesim Example

[Turtlesim](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim.html)
is an *ad hoc* package that ROS2 provides as GUI node example.

##### Set up

Unlike the previous examples turtlesim cannot work on terminal mode. There are several ways to workaround this:
1. Run GUI application in a docker container as shown [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-run-gui-applications-in-a-docker-container/).
1. Share the container network stack with the host.
1. Run Node-RED backend directly in your host (see [installation steps](#install)).

Here we favour the second option as the most simple. This only requires:
+ A ROS2 installation in the host.  Follow the [official ROS2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
  for the distro of choice.
+ Launch the Visual-ROS container sharing host network stack:

```bash
    node-red-ros2-plugin/docker$ docker build --build-arg ROS_DISTRO=humble -t visualros:humble .
    $ docker run -ti --name turtledemo --network host --ipc host visualros:humble /node_entrypoint.sh node-red
```

##### Demo steps

1. Launch `turtlesim` on the host by doing:

```bash
    $ . /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh
    $ ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
   A window should appear with a turtle in the middle.

1. Open a web browser on [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880).

1. Create and wire the following nodes:
   + A `ROS2 Type` node. In the associated dialog set up the turtlesim pose type: `geometry_msgs/Twist`.
   + A couple of `ROS2 Inject` nodes: one to move the turtle forward and another to spin it.
     Wire both nodes to the `ROS2 Type`. Open the associated dialogs and take into account that:
     - mover forward means `linear.x = 1`
     - spin means `angular.z = 1`
   + A `ROS2 Publisher` node. Wire it to the `ROS2 Type` node. Open the associated dialog and set up as:
     - Topic the `turtle/cmd_vel`.
     - Use the default ROS2 domain 0.

1. Click the `Deploy` button.

![turtlesim](./docs/turtlesim.gif)

Now click on the inject nodes buttons within the editor and see how the turtle moves.

This [json file](./docs/turtlesim.json) can be imported to Node-RED in order to reproduce the flow.

### FIWARE nodes usage

The [FIWARE Context Broker](https://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/introduction/) uses a REST API to
provide information. This interface do not exactly follows a Publisher/Subscriber model but can be adapted to do so:
- Broker entities are mapped as Publisher/Subscriber topics.
- Types are described using IDL which works as a subset of the NGSI type system.

#### FIWARE configuration node

A [Node-RED config node](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/concepts#config-node) is provided to set up the FIWARE
Context Broker IPv4 address which is a global selection.

![FIWARE Config Node](./docs/FIWAREsettings.jpg)

#### FIWARE Publisher

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="250"><img name="FIWARE Publisher" src="./docs/FIWAREPublisher.jpg" height="auto"></td>

        <td><img name="FIWARE Publisher Dialog" src="./docs/FIWAREPublisherDialog.jpg" height="auto"/></td>
        <td>The dialog provides controls to configure:

                Address of the FIWARE Context Broker this node will connect to.

                </dd>
            </dl>
        </td>

            </dl>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### FIWARE Examples

#### FIWARE Basic Publication Example

Let's use a custom type.

1. Launch docker compose as explained [here](./docker/README.md).
1. Create and wire the following nodes:
    + An `IDL Type` node. Open the associated dialog and introduce the following idl:

    ```c
    module custom_msgs {
        module msg {
            struct Message {
                string text;
                uint64 value;
            };
        };
    };
    ```
    + A `FIWARE Publisher` node. Open the associated dialog and set up the publisher:

        `Topic`
        : hope

        `Context Broker`
        : `192.168.42.14:1026`

      Note the address and port of the Context Broker was specified in the `compose.yaml` file.

    + A `ROS Inject` node. Open the associated dialog and fill in the fields:

        `text`
        : Hello World!

        `value`
        : 42

1. Deploy the flow pressing the corresponding button.
1. Once deployed, click on the inject node button within the editor. The Context Broker should have created an entity
associated to the topic (`hope`) with the values provided in the inject node.

In order to check it, the FIWARE Context Broker can be directly queried using its REST API (note that in the
`compose.yaml` file the Context Broker port 1026 is mapped to the host machine). Open a console on the host and type:

```bash
$ curl -G -X GET "http://localhost:1026/v2/entities" -d "type=custom_msgs::msg::Message" -d "id=hope"
```

It should return the following json:
```json

#### FIWARE Basic Subscription Example

In this case, a builtin ROS2 type (`geometry_msgs/Point`) will be used.

1. Launch docker compose as explained [here](./docker/README.md).
1. Create and wire the following nodes:
    + A `ROS2 Type` node. Open the associated dialog and select:

        `Package`
        : geometry_msgs

        `Message`
        : Point

    + A `FIWARE Subscriber` node. Open the associated dialog and set up the subscriber:

        `Topic`
        : position

        `Context Broker`
        : `192.168.42.14:1026`

    + A `debug` node from the `common` palette section. Open the associated dialog and set it up to show the x
    coordinate of the point:

        `Output`
        : `msg.x`

1. Deploy the flow pressing the corresponding button.
1. Publish a message on that topic from the FIWARE REST API. Because the `compose.yaml` maps the FIWARE Context Broker
port to a host one (1026) is possible to reach it from the host machine.
Open a console on the host and type:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:1026/v2/entities -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
    "id": "position",
    "type": "geometry_msgs::msg::Point",
    "x": {"value": 42, "type":"Text"},
    "y": {"value": 4, "type":"Text"},
    "z": {"value": 2, "type":"Text"}
}
EOF
```

The debug pan should log an output. In order to *update* the entity value, further http queries should follow:

```bash
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/position/attrs?type=geometry_msgs::msg::Point \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @- <<EOF
{
    "x": {"value": 3, "type":"Text"},
    "y": {"value": 2, "type":"Text"},
    "z": {"value": 1, "type":"Text"}
}
EOF
```
